# SFML 2.5.1 Documentation Docset for Zeal
## Usage
Add Docset link to zeal
``` 
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/denizozgur/SFML.Docset/main/SFML.xml 
```
### Works with Dash but only a single letter search
Not ideal but if you put your mind to it you can use it ðŸ˜ƒ
You need to add the xml link to main docsets list from lower right corner

### Thanks to [Tsoding](https://github.com/tsoding) for build scripts
